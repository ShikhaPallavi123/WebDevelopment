        Iron Man is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. 
        Co-created by writer and editor Stan Lee, developed by scripter Larry Lieber, and 
        designed by artists Don Heck and Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in 
        Tales of Suspense #39 in 1962 (cover dated March 1963) and received his own title 
        with Iron Man #1 in 1968. Shortly after his creation, Iron Man became a founding 
        member of the superhero team, the Avengers, alongside Thor, Ant-Man, the Wasp, and 
        the Hulk. Iron Man stories, individually and with the Avengers, have been published 
        consistently since the character's creation.</p>
        <h2>Publication History</h2>
        <hr/>
        <h3>Premiere</h3>
        <p>Iron Man's earliest stories were published in the monster-themed anthology series Tales of Suspense.
             Marvel premiered several superheroes this way in the 1960s as superhero comics became more popular 
             than traditional science-fiction and horror comics.[9][12] Iron Man's first appearance, "Iron Man 
             is Born!", appeared in Tales of Suspense #39, released in December 1962 with a March 1963 cover date.
             Though the Iron Man armor was gray in its first appearance, Marvel changed it to gold because of issues 
             with printing.[5] Lee initially delegated the writing duties to other creators at Marvel, but he felt 
             their work was substandard; as with his other characters, Lee reclaimed control of Iron Man so he 
             could write the stories himself

             <h3>Solo Series</h3>

                Iron Man was one of several characters whom Marvel gave a full-length dedicated series in 1968.
             Marvel combined the final issues of Tales of Suspense and the Sub-Mariner's Tales to Astonish into 
             a one-shot special, Iron Man and Sub-Mariner.[25] Iron Man then began its run under writer Archie 
             Goodwin.[26] Goodwin reintroduced political themes slowly over the following years, with a focus on 
             domestic issues like racial conflict and environmentalism rather than geopolitics.[27] George 
             Tuska started drawing the character in Iron Man #5 (1968) and intermittently served as artist 
             for much of the 1970s.[28][29] In total, he drew over one hundred issues for the character.

            <h2>Fictional character biography</h2>
            <hr/>
            <p>Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark was born in Long Island, New York. As a child, 
                he inherited his family's business, Stark Industries, when his parents were 
                killed in a car crash.[88] Developing equipment for the U.S. military, 
                he travels to a war zone to conduct a weapons test when he triggers a booby 
                trap. His heart is critically injured by shrapnel, and he is captured by the 
                communist Wong-Chu, who demands Stark build him a weapon. Stark instead builds a 
                suit of armor that sustains his heart, becoming Iron Man.[18][9] The war zone 
                Stark visited was changed retroactively multiple times by different writers 
                to correspond with the character's age, which is explained by a "sliding 
                scale of continuity" in which the timing of significant events in the 
                world of Marvel may change. This conflict was the Vietnam War for the 
                first decades of Iron Man's publication history.[89] This was changed 
                to an unnamed Southeast Asian country in the 1990s,[90] and a conflict 
                in the fictional country Siancong was ultimately created to justify the inconsistency.
